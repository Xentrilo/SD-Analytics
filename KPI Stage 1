Core KPI Metrics Identified
Revenue Metrics: Total Revenue, Service Calls, Labor, Avg $ per call
Profitability Metrics: Total Profit, Avg Profit per call
Performance Indicators: Completed Calls, FTC %, Diagnostic ONLY %, RECALL %
Business Goals: >70% First Time Complete, >10-20% Diagnostics Only, ~5% Recalls
Data Integration Strategy
Cross-Reference Methodology:
Match invoice numbers between Sales Journal and Type6reports
Link technician codes to GPS device names using your provided mapping
Correlate job timestamps with GPS location data for validation
Text Analysis for Classification:
Extract job categories and outcomes from WorkDescription field
Identify keywords that indicate diagnostics-only, recalls, and quick fixes
Create pattern recognition for completed vs. multi-visit jobs
Financial Calculation Framework:
Calculate revenue using SCallSold, LaborSold fields from Sales Journal
Track service call zone pricing ($129/$149/$60 additional appliance)
Derive profitability metrics using standard margin assumptions
Job Classification Logic
Diagnostic ONLY: Jobs with no parts used or specifically noted in WorkDescription
FTC (First Time Complete): Where CompletedOnFirstTrip = "Yes" or HowManyVisits = 1
RECALLS: Jobs with recall keywords in WorkDescription or Make/Model fields
Data Processing Requirements
Data Cleaning Steps:
Standardize technician codes across systems
Handle inconsistent date formats between reports
Manage missing data in critical fields
Derived Metrics Calculations:
Revenue per job type
Time efficiency (if incorporating GPS data)
Performance against business goals
Aggregation Methods:
By technician
By time period (monthly reporting)
By job category and appliance type
Visualization Approach
HTML-based visual dashboard showing all KPIs
Progress bars/indicators for goals (FTC %, Diagnostic %, Recall %)
Sortable technician comparison table
Month-to-month trend analysis
This framework provides the blueprint for creating your KPI system, incorporating the data sources you have available while establishing a foundation that can be enhanced with GPS data for deeper insights.
