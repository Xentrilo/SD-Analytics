When unplugged machine noticed burning on plug.  Tested power at wall with machine unplugged and still inconsistent readings though at times able to get 240 volts which likely means that there is burning or scoring on contact points inside of outlet.  Filed plug and able to get heating for approximately twenty to thirty seconds before more sparking at outlet.  Disassembled machine and tested all components.  All thermal cutoffs, the heating element and temperature sensors testing normally.

1/23/25 12:46 AJ: I checked the tracks per Shane to make sure they came with the wheels needed, which they did not. Shane stated that if that were the case, we cannot complete this repair as the manufacturer is not making the correct parts for this model. He had received the specific part numbers from Whirlpool tech support, who told him to check the parts as they may not have what is needed on them.  I reached out to Shane to let him know this so that he can update the customer and so that he can speak with Whirlpool again if needed.

Educated on how to restart cycle by pushing start and closing the door before the 4 second countdown on the screen times out (which then results in beeping).  Machine also has several stored error codes an Fae3 shorted vent error code, which can happen when door repeatedly opened during cycle causing a temporary short in the vent. Also had an F9E2 locked drain motor error code, however draining normally meaning that likely something was caught in the drain pump then cleared out, and a F5 E1 door stuck open error code which happens when door is opened during cycle and the cycle is not continued.  Ran diagnostic cycle and machine able to complete cycle with no error codes.  Problem likely lies with failing to correctly start cycle again after door opened during cycle.  If problem continues and door is no longer opened in the middle of the cycle repeatedly would likely need to replace vent.; (serial indicated as 'NotAvailable' so system created UIS w/pseudo #), Job Cmpltd, O-emld tckt [Tckts\17710a.png], snapped 1 QuickPics (via SDM)

I cannot even escalate as it clearly stated in the entitelment that this machine was not eligeable for warranty. I reminded Laura she needs to be checking the entitlements and ensure that it is not marked as a field scrap appliance before scheduling.

He stated he would check with Mark to see if we'd be willing to uninstall it with two men, and no waiver signed/to see what he thinks in regard to all of this, and that he will let us know if we are able to assist the customer with getting in uninstalled and moved, or if Mark also agrees that she will need to get a contractor out first.

They reset the fuse multiple times but have also replaced it with minimal to no impact.  Tested cooling fan which is running normally and cools the cavity where thermal fuse and main control board are housed.  Likely fan not running long enough on its own to cool cavity and coupled with the fact that the oven is used long periods of time during events, this causes it to blow.   changing control board will not change this parameter.

Took picture of broken glass cooktop, removed new burner and noticed no damage to burner or evidence of arcing, also took picture of burner.  Burner and switch are still functional.

Machine functioning as per manufacturer specifications but likely due to lower water usage not washing out clothing as well as her old machine.  Customer showed pictures of lint like debris on her clothing after wash.

I let her know that due to the damage to the part, we did need to cancel the appt for this afternoon. I let her know that once we have located a new part for her, I will reach out asap with an update.
1/29/25 8:47 AJ: Dane stated he thinks we may actually have this board somewhere in the shop. He stated to hold off on ordering on eBay until Porter confirms whether or not he was able to locate one in the shop. Per Dane, order eBay part # 176401101409 if board cannot be  located in shop.

2/5/25 13:30 AJ: I checked eBay again for tracking update. Shows it is still awaiting shipment. I will keep checking.
2/6/25 13:35 AJ: I checked eBay again, still shows awaiting shipment. I contacted the seller by sending them a message asking that they please provide an update on when they will be getting the part shipped out so that we can then receive tracking information so that we can schedule with customer.
2/10/25 16:05 AJ: Finally received a response from the seller on eBay, who stated they did not actually have part available. I cancelled the order we had placed with them. Looking on eBay for another one we could purchase, I am not locating one, all the other ones are notating that it's only the touch panel, it does not have the board. I left a note for DM about this asking if the panel is all that's needed (he had looked at the original one we received and said it was broken so it got tossed), or if the board needs to be included. I also asked what other repair options we can offer customer if the eBay parts are not going to work.
2/11/25 10:04 AJ: Mark called and left message with customer providing an update. He was able to locate a used panel on eBay that may work for $500.00, or a new one on eBay that is $775.00. He asked that the customer call back to confirm which route they may like to go. I can order either panel once customer confirms the route they would like to take.
2/11/25 11:00 AJ: Mark confirmed with me to move forward with ordering the NEW control panel off of eBay. I did place the order. EBay states we should be receiveing the part by end of day 02/21/25

1/28/25 15:22 AJ: Left message with Giselle confirming we received online appt request for refrigerator. Giselle is with Bundesen Property Management. I let her know the address that came through on the online request is their office address, and asked that she call back to confirm if the refrigerator is located at their office, or if there is a specific rental property address this needs to be scheduled for. I let her know that once we have confirmation on service location address, we can get an appt scheduled.
1/28/25 15:39 AJ: Spoke with Giselle, she provided the service address (18 Rowe Ranch Dr, Novato), and she asked what was done most recently with the ice maker. I let her know Ricardo noted that the ice maker needed to be reset. She asked to get more info from him on what exactly was done. I let her know he is currently away at a training, and that I could not confirm how quickly he would be able to get back to her/me with that information, but that I would give her a call asap once he has gotten back to me with more info on the resetting of the ice maker.
1/30/25 14:01 AJ: Ricardo got back to me, stated that the ice maker has a reset button, and that the tenant can attempt to press the reset button to see if that resolves ice maker issue. Ricardo confirmed that when he was out in June and reset the ice maker, that he did wait and did confirm that the ice maker started cycling and was working properly. He stated that if ice maker is now not working, there could be a new issue going on, and we can go out and take a look. I called and left prop manager Giselle (707-769-7174) a message with all the information Ricardo relayed to me, and let her know that we can absolutely go out to take a look at what is going on if she'd like us to.

I gave report to whirlpool, they also said that if they push back on the call for any reason,they have a couple testing methods that engineering will wnat folks to do to rule this out.

1. Unplug condenser fan and run machine see how temperatures change on the center divide heat exchange.
2. check for bowing or buckling center, use a straight edge get pictures....

2/5/25 14:21 AJ: John Green emailed again asking for part update. I spoke with Shane who stated to me that he is still trying to get in touch and get accurate part information from Blue Star so that we can get the needed part ordered. He stated it has been a struggle to reach them, and get accurate part information. He let me know he is trying to reach out to them again today, and will reach out to John directly with an update. I emailed John back relaying this information.
2/11/25 15:11 AJ: Per Shane, he would like part # 189701 ordered from BlueStar, he will need to check the part before we schedule as he is not sure it is even the correct part, but BlueStar reps have not been helpful in regard to locating the correct part needed. I may need to call them to order, part number not pulling up on their website to order. I reached out to Shane to confirm part number just in case it was mistyped in his message.`
2/14/25 11:02 AJ: I have not been able to reach a Blue Star rep who can assist me with parts ordering via phone, so I did go ahead and submit an inquiry on their websit about ordering part, and requesting details on how I can get the part ordered/a call back. I also emailed sales@bluestarcooking.com

Tested outlet with circuit tester and is wired correctly. Washer did trip breaker on regular wash cycle after filling, agitating for three minutes before pausing to do something (shift gear or sense or add more water or sense?)  then after pause it tripped breaker.  recommending customer use non-GFCI circuit with an extension cord to isolate problem.Upon looking underneath the machine, I discovered that stater rubs against the rotor as it spins around, making a noise took off stater  needs new gear case. Left two messages for Amy and called a few times to let her know what is going on.

I am seeing we already received an autho number as it is notated in the job record. I reached out to Porter to get clarification on what is going on as customer would like update before scheduling repair.

Porter stated he will be calling the customer to provide them this update, give them repair costs, and will then let us know whether or not customer would like to move forward with the repair.
1/17/25 11:38 LL: Safety team called. Had customer on the other line. They were hoping to find out the labor rate so they could let the customer know. Unfortunately that is not in the estimate. We will need to call the customer directly with the labor rate. If the customer accepts, he will call Wp. Then wp will will send over the pad covering parts. PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE PART PRICING TO CUSTOMER PER WHIRLPOOL.

3/14/25 10:14 AJ: I emailed Brian at Lowe's letting him know that the delivery team did not install the new range, nor did they haul away the old range. I asked that he give us credit/a refund for any charges related to the installation and haul away, as well as for any gas lines, etc. that we were charged for as the installation and haul away did not take place via Lowe's, and our own techs had to go at the end of their days to install the new range, and then haul away and dispose of the old appliance, and used a gas line from our own stock.""",,,,,,,
