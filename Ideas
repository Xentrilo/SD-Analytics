Brainstorming:

Enhanced Time-Location Correlation Engine
Create a "location dictionary" that maps common destinations (shop, technicians' homes, frequent service locations)
Implement address standardization that handles common geolocation errors
Define "arrival rules" (e.g., how close to an address counts as arrival)
Flag arrivals at non-scheduled locations as potential ad-hoc jobs or personal stops
Possibility: Develop a confidence score for each job-location match
Technician Activity & Performance Dashboard
Visualize daily activity patterns with color-coded timelines (driving, on-site, idle)
Calculate metrics like:
Average jobs completed per day
Revenue generated per hour of work time
Percentage of day spent productively at job sites
Extra jobs beyond standard workload
Compare metrics across technicians with similar roles
Possibility: Develop a commission calculator that automatically estimates earnings based on GPS-validated jobs
Vehicle Utilization Analytics
Break down vehicle utilization by:
Productive time (at customer locations)
Essential transit (between jobs)
Shop time (parts pickup, meetings)
Idle time (categorized by duration and location)
Track patterns over time to identify trends
Possibility: Create alerts for unusual patterns (extended idle time, excessive shop visits)


Streamlit Explained
Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it incredibly easy to create interactive web applications for data analysis and visualization. It's designed specifically for data scientists and analysts who want to share their work without needing to be web developers.
Key Features of Streamlit:
Python-Only: Write apps entirely in Python - no HTML, CSS, or JavaScript required
Live Reloading: Changes to your code update the app in real-time
Interactive Widgets: Easily add sliders, buttons, dropdowns, date pickers, file uploaders
Data Visualization: Direct integration with most Python visualization libraries
Caching: Smart caching system for performance optimization
Deployment Options: Free community cloud hosting or self-host
Simple Streamlit Example:

Why Streamlit Makes Sense for Your Project:
Rapid development - build dashboards in hours, not weeks
Perfect for your CSV-based workflow
Handles the visualization side while letting you focus on data processing
Easy to create exactly the KPI dashboard you described
Can be run locally or shared with stakeholders via Streamlit Cloud

First Steps Suggestion
Start by building a simple data loader and cleaner for Type6 and Sales Journal
Create basic technician revenue metrics dashboard
Implement the job classification logic for Diagnostic ONLY, FTC, and RECALLS
Add visualizations for performance against goals
Once core KPIs are working, begin GPS data integration

Potential Challenges to Anticipate
Address Matching: Prepare for inconsistent formatting between systems
Time Alignment: GPS timestamps may not perfectly align with recorded job times
Text Analysis Reliability: WorkDescription fields may be inconsistently formatted or incomplete
Edge Cases: Canceled jobs, revisits, and unusual scenarios will need special handling

Implementation Recommendations
Start with a Minimal Viable Product: Build the core KPI dashboard first, then incrementally add GPS integration
Create a Data Dictionary: Document all fields from both systems for consistent interpretation
Implement Data Validation Rules: Set up automated checks for data quality and completeness
Build a Feedback Loop: Include a way for users to flag suspicious data points for review
Technical Considerations
Incremental Processing: Design your system to handle incremental data updates rather than always reprocessing everything
Data Cache Strategy: Consider caching processed results to improve dashboard performance
Configuration File: Use a config file for business rules (pricing tiers, goal thresholds) for easy updates
Date Handling: Pay special attention to timezone issues between different data sources
